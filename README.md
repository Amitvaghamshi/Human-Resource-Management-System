# Human Resource Management System

The Human Resource Management System (HRMS) is a console-based application developed using Java, MySQL, and JDBC that provides a comprehensive solution for managing employees and their related tasks in an organization. The application is designed to streamline the HR processes, automate routine HR tasks, and provide efficient management of employee-related information.


Admin Panel:
The Admin Panel is designed for HR or management personnel to manage employees and their related tasks. 
The admin can access a dashboard that provides an overview of key HR metrics such as employee count, pending leave requests, and salary information. 
The admin can perform various tasks such as employee onboarding, leave management, salary management, and employee data management.
The admin can manage leave requests by screening and approving or rejecting leave requests submitted by employees.
The admin can also manage employee salaries.
The admin has the authority to manage employee data, including updating employee details, managing employee roles and permissions, and deactivating employees who have left the organization or are no longer active.


Employee Panel:
Employees can request leaves by specifying the type of leave, start and end dates, and reason. Employees can view the status of their leave requests, whether they are pending, approved, or rejected.
Employees can also view their salary details
